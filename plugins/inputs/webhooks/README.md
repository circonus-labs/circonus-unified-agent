# Webhooks Input Plugin

This is a service plugin that start an http server and register multiple webhook listeners.

```sh
circonus-unified-agent config -input-filter webhooks -output-filter circonus > config.conf.new
```

Change the config file to point to add Circonus API token key you are using and adjust the settings to match your environment. Once that is complete:

```sh
cp config.conf.new /etc/circonus-unified-agent/circonus-unified-agent.conf
sudo service circonus-unified-agent start
```

### Configuration

```toml
[[inputs.webhooks]]
  instance_id = "" # unique instance identifier (REQUIRED)

  ## Address and port to host Webhook listener on
  service_address = ":1619"

    path = "/mandrill"

  [inputs.webhooks.rollbar]

### Adding new webhooks plugin

1. Add your webhook plugin inside the `webhooks` folder
1. Your plugin must implement the `Webhook` interface
1. Import your plugin in the `webhooks.go` file and add it to the `Webhooks` struct

Both [Github](github/) and [Rollbar](rollbar/) are good example to follow.
